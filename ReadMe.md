# üìó About the Project :

This is a python project where I try to make a discord bot basically<br>
Of course, its far from being the best bot out there but it is a project I made to test my skills on Python

Just a silly maid mouse for all of your needs~<br>
This project was made to come with as many features as you could see on many bots while being fully free to use, without any paywalls or any voting requirements.<br>
It is of course open-source as it also could serve as a quick reference for those who wanna start up a new bot on their own or if anyone wanna improve it overall.

# ‚≠êÔ∏è Support :

Pull requests are opens and accepted!<br>
Along with any kind of support~ üòä
