=====
<p>This is a python project where I try to make a discord bot basically<br>
Of course, its far from being the best bot out there but it is a project I made to test my skills on Python</p>

-----

It will requierds a *"configs.json"* file in order to work which will contains the following entries:

Mandary >>
- **token (string):** token used to connect your bot

Optional >>
- **maxLogs (integer):** amount of logs saved, currently generated excluded (default: 5) (-1 for keeping everything)
- **cmdPrefix (string):** prefix used for calling commands in channels (default: "!")
