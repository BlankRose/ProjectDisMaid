"""
A basic command to mute someone with some extra parameters to \
work around. We hope muting can calm those nasty poeple..

__ARGUMENTS:__
`User` - *User to target (dont try on me plz)*
`Time` - *How long they shall be muted*
`Reason` - *Why do you want to mute them*
`DM` - *Wether or not we shall notify the user in their DMs*

__UNSPECIFIED VALUES:__
`Time` - *Will be treated as* `inf`
`DM` - *Will be treated as* `True`

__SIDE NOTES:__
`Time` can be set as following `.y.d.h.m.s` (where dots are numbers)
`Time` can also be set to `inf` for long term mute
By default, this command will use discord's timeout feature but this \
one is limited to 28 days by the API! This behavior can be switch to \
role-based which allows much longer mute timespan (currently WIP)

__REQUIERED PERMISSIONS:__
Application: `Moderate Members`
Caller: `Moderate Members`
