					work around. We hope muting can calm those nasty poeple..\n
					ARGUMENTS:
					`User` - *User to target (dont try on me plz)*
					`Time` - *How long they shall be muted*
					`Reason` - *Why do you want to mute them*
					`DM` - *Wether or not we shall notify the user in their DMs*\n
					UNSPECIFIED VALUES:
					`Time` - *Will be treated as* `inf`
					`DM` - *Will be treated as* `True`\n
					SIDE NOTES:
					`Time` can be set as following `.y.d.h.m.s` (where dots are numbers)
					`Time` can also be set to `inf` for long term mute
					By default, this command will use discord's timeout feature but this
					one is limited to 28 days by the API! This behavior can be switch to
					role-based which allows much longer mute timespan (currently WIP)"""
